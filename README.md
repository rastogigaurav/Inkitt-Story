## # Story

This is a sample project created to demonstrate a simple story reading application developed using React Native.

Creating React Native App is the easiest way to start building a new React Native application. It allows you to start a project without installing or configuring any tools to build native code - no Xcode or Android Studio installation required

Currently the application is calling a web service to fetch data ( related to a story:chapter) from server and utilizing the received response onto client(mobile).
